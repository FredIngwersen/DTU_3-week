# DTU_3-week

<b>OVERVIEW: Java IRC Server Project</b>

<b>Java Server:</b>

To start with, there needs to be a server to handle all the traffic. This has to be written in Java per requirement of the course.

The server will be a multithreaded server, using the IRC and possibly HTTP protocols.

<b>Client side:</b>

The client side will be written in HTML & JavaScript. It will feature a sort of login screen; one will be required to make up a "Nickname", no passwords as of writing this.

The client will also feature a place to write in text messages to the other users online, this will all end up in a livefeed.
