        <h1>OVERVIEW: Java IRC Server Project</h1>

        <h2> Java Server:</h2>
        
        <p>To start with, there needs to be a server to handle all the traffic. This has to be written in Java per requirement of the course. </p>
        <p> The server will be a multithreaded server, using the IRC and possibly HTTP protocols.</p>
        
        <h2>Client side: </h2>
        
        <p>The client side will be written in HTML & JavaScript. It will feature a sort of login screen; one will be required to make up a "Nickname", no passwords as of writing this. </p>
        <p>The client will also feature a place to write in text messages to the other users online, this will all end up in a livefeed.</p>
